# IoT Smart Sensor Monitoring System

This project is an IoT-based system that monitors environmental data such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **LED status** using NodeMCU ESP8266. The data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database and displayed in a mobile app. The system is designed to provide real-time data visualization for monitoring room conditions efficiently.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Track temperature and humidity changes in real-time.
- **LED Control**: View the status of an LED light and remotely monitor its state.
- **Mobile Interface**: Access the data through a user-friendly mobile app with intuitive UI elements.
- **Firebase Integration**: Data is stored in and retrieved from Firebase Realtime Database for seamless cloud access.

## System Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **NodeMCU ESP8266**: Reads sensor data (temperature, humidity) and sends it to Firebase.
2. **Firebase Realtime Database**: Acts as the central cloud storage for all sensor data and states.
3. **Mobile Application**: Displays the sensor data on a clean and responsive UI, allowing users to monitor the environment.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **NodeMCU ESP8266** board
- **DHT11/DHT22 sensor** for temperature and humidity readings
- **Firebase Project** for data storage
- **Mobile Device** for viewing the data

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Set up the Firebase Realtime Database for storing sensor data.
3. Download the `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS, and add them to the respective project folders.

### Hardware Setup

- Connect the **DHT11/DHT22 sensor** to the NodeMCU ESP8266.
- The sensor will send **temperature** and **humidity** data to the ESP8266, which will then be pushed to Firebase.

### Mobile App Features

- **Sensor Data Visualization**: The app displays the current **temperature** and **humidity** in the monitored area.
- **LED Status**: A visual indicator in the app shows whether the LED connected to the NodeMCU is ON or OFF.
